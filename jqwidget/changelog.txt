some data needed in js list moved to jquery general
and js compress plugin.php enqueue to wp
add an script in jsxcompressor directory for compress data 
some change in json.php to compress and write in js in tempbin directory with 50char random name and after that
it will be deleted by list script .js by calling and passing tempfile delete-temp-file.php and more
how work compressor:
1.json.php will not return json anymore it will compress json and write in the file in tempbin directory the name specified
by list script and passed to to json.php by get method (its a js file and commpressed str in var h variable
2.the list script wait complete and then load tempfile created by json.php and decompress h variable -that the original json needed
3.call delete-temp-file.php by jquery.get after calling json.php and h decompressed load
to delete the tempfile to save host space it pass tempfile name to know whatshould be deleted
Note: some change was needed we use now localdata in jqwidget and use jquery.get to call json.php and even delete tempfile
